   - SCALE18x

   - Melissa Loudon, Andrew Li
** goals and motivation
   - goal
     - share experiences (two-way) with tools and techniques for creating and
       editing video tutorials and lectures
   - motivation
     - coding vs gui's: text documentation can be less user friendly
       for guis compared to code and command line
       - I'm no longer dismissive of video tutorials
     - demand: my students seem to like videos
       - videos from lectures
       - tutorial videos
     - scratching an itch
       - making videos more artful
       - using open source when possible
       - saving time and being a more effective teacher (e.g. flipped classroom)
** going beyond audio+screen capture
   - talking head: is it useful?
   - black/white board
   - over the shoulders, hands
   - 5 shot sequence
   - cutshots
   - slides, animations
** 5 shot sequence
   - hands close up
   - face close up
   - wide shot with context/environment with subject in it
   - over the shoulders
   - creative shot with unusual perspective displaying something else the view should know
   - hello scale18x I hope you enjoy the presentation!!


** demo
   - idea: combining graphviz and sozi
** openshot
   - nice simple interface
     - I'd probably use this instead of premier pro (premier rush:
       simplified interface)
** open questions, conclusion
   - open questions:
     - is a talking head necessary or useful?
     - what are the best sharing platforms
     - licensing issues
     - audience experiences
     - workflow efficiencies
     - I still have a lot of class material as handouts (pdf with
       screenshots), should I keep both to accommodate different
       learning styles?
